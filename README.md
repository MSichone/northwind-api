# northwind-api
A Spring Boot project to recreate the Northwind database that was originally created by Microsoft and used as the basis for their tutorials in a variety of database products for decades.

### About
The Northwind database is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting.

This is the simple database released for Access 95-2003.

Microsoft has gradually enhanced Northwind (and recently deprecated it, although it is quite forward-compatible).

For this project we will use a schema quite different to the earlier versions that was released with Office 2007.
